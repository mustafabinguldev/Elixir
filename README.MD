# Elixir Beginner Project

This project contains sample code written in the Elixir programming language. Elixir is a functional, concurrent, and distributed programming language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is ideal for applications requiring high performance and scalability.

## What is Elixir?

Elixir is a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (VM). It was designed for building scalable and maintainable applications, particularly for web development and distributed systems. Elixir leverages the power of Erlang's concurrency and fault-tolerant features, making it ideal for high-availability applications.

### Features:
- **Functional Programming**: Elixir encourages immutability and data transformations rather than state changes.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Elixir provides built-in support for lightweight concurrent processes, making it well-suited for multi-core processing.
- **Distributed Systems**: Elixir is built for distributed applications, enabling seamless communication between nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in error handling and process isolation help ensure that one failing part of the system does not bring down the whole system.
- **Scalability**: Elixir's concurrency model allows for large-scale systems with minimal effort.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run Elixir on your system, you will need to install both Erlang and Elixir.

- **Erlang**: Elixir runs on the Erlang virtual machine (VM), so Erlang must be installed first.
- **Elixir**: After Erlang is installed, Elixir can be installed as well.

### Installation

#### Windows
1. **Using Chocolatey**: The easiest way to install Elixir on Windows is through the Chocolatey package manager. First, install Chocolatey if you haven't already, and then run the following command:
   ```bash
   choco install elixir
